# CodeAlpha - Simple URL Shortener

This project is developed as part of the CodeAlpha Backend Development Internship.

It is a REST API built using Node.js and Express that converts long URLs into short, unique links. When a user accesses the short URL, it automatically redirects to the original long URL.

The URL mappings are stored in a JSON file for simplicity and easy data handling.

This project demonstrates basic backend development concepts such as routing, API creation, unique ID generation, and data storage.
